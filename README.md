My View
=======

University project to create a single page website on something you care about - I produced a page about the london skyline I can see out of my window

HTML5/CSS3/JQuery/Google Search API

Responsive single page site. Side scroll to see more of the skyline. Hover on buildings to view their name, click to view more information and see some images pulled through from google.
